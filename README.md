💻 Digital Forensics Investigation: The Cyberbullying Case
📋 Case Objective

 Our team is conducting a complete digital forensic investigation of a Windows 10 desktop computer belonging to a student, John Smith, who is suspected of cyberbullying. Using a provided forensic disk image, our objective is to forensically prove or disprove his involvement in the harassment of a fellow student, Jane Doe.

We will focus our analysis on recovering and analyzing chat logs, locating an embarrassing "meme" video, and examining user activity, including browser history and USB device connections, to determine if John Smith's computer was used to create, distribute, and send harassing content.
